# URL SHORTENER APP

![A GM bot](https://github.com/AngelLozan/Discord-GM-bot/blob/master/gm.jpeg?raw=true)

An application developed using php, javascript and a local xampp server. Developed on Linux Ubuntu on a home-built computer. 

## Use case:

Part of my work and the work of my team is concerned with social media and providing technical support to individuals via social media. Therefore, it is important to have a strong vehicle for delivering content-rich documents in a space with limited character count and the competing need to address individuals seeking help in a friendly, empathetic way. 

*The problem:*

URL-shorteners are built into multiple different social-media aggregation and mangement platforms, and are widely used today to meet a multitude of demands. However, platforms such as Brandwatch or Hootsuite, two of the more popular social-media management tools available on the market currently cost thousands of dollars on a monthly or yearly basis depending on the scale of a subscribing organzation. This makes these platforms difficult to utilize except on an enterprise scale with a generous budge. 

*One possible solution:*

Build a social-media aggregation tool on par with those available. Such a tool could be customizable and utlize pre-existing APIs for each platform. Some historical context on each channel might be sacraficed based on the current rules for API utilization (ie: Youtube), though this is a minor consideration when viewed in light of the cost. 

*Why:*
Working at a global tech company, it is highly possible to develop this kind of software, though it would be a large undertaking. However, the infrastructure needed to develop a platform at such a scale as needed is entirely possible given the current infrastructure. Additionally, I've been able to replicate multple pieces of the existing platforms with little effort, the reload and url-shortening functions as examples of this.
